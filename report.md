# Q-learning: 

- Implemented Q-learning using PyTorch. 
- Ran the algorithm on the Taxi environment from OpenAI Gym. 
- Compared performance against [(https://www.kaggle.com/code/karthikcs1/reinforcement-learning-taxi-v3-openai/notebook)], 
- For eps = 0.1, it required 1e4 episodes to converge, while for my implementation, it required 1e5 episodes to converge.
